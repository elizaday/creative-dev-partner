# Creative Development Partner

An AI-powered creative ideation tool for advertising and content development. Transforms client briefs into fully developed creative concepts through a structured workflow.

## Overview

This tool takes you through a four-phase creative development process:

1. **Brief Upload** - Paste your client brief
2. **10 Ideas** - AI generates 10 wildly different creative directions
3. **Variations** - Get 3 variations on your selected concepts
4. **Final 3** - Receive fully developed concepts with scenes, references, and production notes

Built with React, Express, and Claude API (Sonnet 4.5).

## Features

- **AI-Powered Ideation**: Real creative concepts generated by Claude, not templates
- **Structured Workflow**: Proven 4-phase process for narrowing ideas
- **Session Persistence**: Save and load previous sessions
- **Elegant UI**: Dark theme with smooth animations
- **Fast Development**: Vite for frontend, Node watch mode for backend

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## Setup

### 1. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend

```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
PORT=3001
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Application

You'll need two terminal windows.

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend

### 4. Open the App

Navigate to **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Paste Your Brief**
   - Include project details, objectives, tone, constraints
   - Minimum 50 characters required
   - Click "Generate 10 Ideas"

2. **Review Ideas**
   - 10 diverse creative concepts will be generated
   - Select up to 5 that resonate
   - Click "Get Variations on Selected"

3. **Choose Variations**
   - Each selected idea gets 3 variations (different tone, pacing, structure)
   - Pick your favorite version of each
   - Select 3 total to develop
   - Click "Develop Final 3"

4. **Final Concepts**
   - Receive fully developed concepts with:
     - Detailed descriptions
     - Scene breakdowns
     - Visual reference notes
     - Production considerations
     - Rationale for the brief

### Example Brief

```
PROJECT: :30 Commercial for Mr. Pibb

KEY MESSAGE: 'Built Different — No advanced degree required to have a good time'
TONE: Dry, observational comedy. Deadpan. Cinematic seriousness applied to simple moments.
CONSTRAINTS: AI-led production, minimal human performance, object-focused storytelling
TARGET: Adults 25-40 who appreciate understated humor
```

### Session Management

- `GET /api/sessions` - List all saved sessions
- `POST /api/sessions` - Save current session
- `GET /api/sessions/:id` - Load specific session
- `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` - Delete session

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Auto-restarts on file changes
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Hot module replacement
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Output will be in frontend/dist/
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to generate ideas"
- Check that your `.env` file has a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Verify the backend server is running on port 3001
- Check backend console for error messages

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your Anthropic API key is valid
- Check your API usage limits at console.anthropic.com
- Make sure the key starts with `sk-ant-`

### Port Conflicts
- If port 3000 or 3001 is in use, change in:
  - Backend: `backend/.env` (PORT variable)
  - Frontend: `frontend/vite.config.js` (server.port)

### Sessions Not Saving
- Check that `sessions/` directory exists in project root
- Verify write permissions on the directory

## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Better Briefs

Include:
- **Project type** (commercial, campaign, social content)
- **Brand/product name**
- **Core objective** (what problem are you solving?)
- **Key message** (the one thing viewers should remember)
- **Tone** (funny, serious, warm, edgy, etc.)
- **Constraints** (budget, format, production limits)
- **Target audience**

The more specific your brief, the more relevant the AI-generated concepts will be.

### Navigating the Phases

- **Phase 1-2**: Be open-minded. Some "wild" ideas often spark better thinking.
- **Phase 2-3**: Select diverse approaches, not just safe ones.
- **Phase 3-4**: The variations can shift tone significantly—pay attention to "shift" notes.
